Hello!

This is the narrator and this project is my attempt to share the
little bit of Common Lisp knowledge and tricks that I have picked up
over the years and to learn something myself in the process. Oh, and
to have fun too!

The recommended way to become familiar with the academy is to start
with the first commit either on github or with local git tools and to
work your way through commits attempting to understand at least the
jist if not the entirety of what is going on. Or, alternatively, you
could just fire it up and with the help of HELP, explore.

Peace and happy hacking!
